## Data and privacy

Evanovar RAM stores its persistent data in `AccountManagerData`. This includes saved accounts, settings, groups, recent games, local Roblox settings, avatar cache, and diagnostic logs.

The application does not include hidden telemetry, advertising SDKs, or analytics tracking. Network communication is limited to enabled or requested functionality:

- Roblox API requests for account, game, presence, authentication, and download features.
- GitHub requests for release and update checks.
- Discord webhook requests when Discord integration is configured.
- Connectivity checks used by Auto-Rejoin.

Account cookies and stored WebSocket passwords remain local unless the user explicitly enables a feature that sends related data elsewhere.

## Build from source

Install the locked runtime and build dependencies, then run the shared build script:

```powershell
uv sync --locked --group build
uv run --no-sync python scripts/build.py
```

The executable is written to `dist/EvanovarRAM.exe`. Build configuration lives in `packaging/EvanovarRAM.spec`, and version metadata is generated during the build. Release builds also create `dist/EvanovarRAM-v<version>.exe` for GitHub Releases.

`src/utils/version.py` is the single source of truth for the application version. Release tags must match `APP_VERSION`.

## System changes and uninstallation

Depending on enabled features, Evanovar RAM can:

- Create and update files under `AccountManagerData`.
- Register or remove Windows startup and Start Menu entries.
- Download portable Chromium, Handle64, or Roblox deployment files when requested.
- Temporarily mark Roblox settings as read-only when Advanced Auto Apply is enabled.
- Temporarily move Roblox installer files into the application quarantine folder.

To uninstall:

1. Exit the application from the window or system tray.
2. Delete the application folder or executable.
3. Delete `AccountManagerData` to remove saved accounts, settings, and logs.
4. Remove any startup or Start Menu entry that was enabled in the application.
